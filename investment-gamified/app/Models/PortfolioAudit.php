/**
 * Portfolio Audit (Immutable Ledger)
 * 
 * IMMUTABILITY CONTRACT:
 * This model represents an append-only, immutable transaction ledger.
 * Once created, audit records MUST NOT be updated, deleted, or modified by application code.
 * 
 * WHY IMMUTABLE?
 * - Prevents accidental data corruption and cover-up of trading errors
 * - Enables forensic analysis of user disputes (refund requests, balance mismatches)
 * - Simplifies compliance audits and regulatory investigations
 * - Guarantees historical data integrity
 * 
 * RETENTION POLICY:
 * - Operational default: 730 days (2 years) enforced by 'audit:clean' command
 * - NOT automatically scheduled; admins must configure in production
 * - Compliance requirement override: See CleanOldAudits.php for regulated alternatives
 * 
 * TECHNICAL SAFEGUARDS:
 * - Application-level guards: update() and delete() throw exceptions
 * - Mass updates via query builder are blocked
 * - DB-level triggers can be added (optional) for defense-in-depth
 * - Archived partitions: For regulated use, DROP old partitions instead of DELETE rows
 * 
 * See: PRODUCTION_SCALE_FIXES_GUIDE.md "Audit Retention vs Compliance Guardrail"
 *      documentation/REFACTOR_02_AUDIT_LEDGER.md
